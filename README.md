# Overview
This repository contains practice materials on Python, used to deliver online training course. The course was sponsered by **[codenics](http://codanics.com/)** and **[Scholership Network](https://www.facebook.com/groups/scholarships.pk/)**. **Pakistan**
This course is for everyone who want to make their carrer/graphs/scientific Publication Chart in data science. The instructor was Dr. Ammar Tufail.

__Objectives__: 
  1. Expand the cohort Students with intermediate-level Python skills; 
  2. contribute to quality of Data Scientist  Resources in Pakistan; and 
  3. Non computer back ground can expand the graphs/chart for their publication using code and libraries.

__Prerequisites and format__: No prior coding experience is needed. The sessions will comprise short lecture-style teaching by the instructor, Interactive session and assignmnets session where every participants write code on their own laptops and show thier output.

__Participant outcomes__: With no coding knowledge before the course, participants should be able to access and combine a diverse set of datasets, conduct data exploration and visualization, utilize Python libraries for demographic, image data and machine learning, and be able to self-teach next steps in their specialized domain.

# Project work
To gain credit, participants are required to submit a complete set of assignments, notebooks compiled in one file or should be in detailed projects groups. The format is a Jupyter Notebook/PDF. The notebook should ingest, analyze and visualize data using Python, to address the real understaing of the students and need of the participant's.

# Running the scripts
Two methods:
* _Beginner method:_ Click the links to 'open notebook in Colab.' (no software installation required)
* _Preferred method:_ Install Anaconda Navigator from the software catalogue on eServices. Download the scripts (or clone the repository with Git) and load the notebooks (.ipynb files) in Jupyter Notebooks on your laptop.
* _Preferred method:_ After cloning open the terminal and run the below command if you are able to do it. Other wise install it manually.

```python
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
